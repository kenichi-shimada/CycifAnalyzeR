\describe{
\item{\code{type}}{A character vector specifying the type of nearest neighbors. Possible values are 'frnn' or 'knn'.}

\item{\code{id}}{A list of integer vector (length of the number of cell neighborhoods). Each vector contains the ids of the fixed radius nearest neighbors.}

\item{\code{dist}}{A list with distances (same structure as id)}

\item{\code{k}}{A numeric vector (scalar) containing the number of neighbors k that was used.}

\item{\code{eps}}{A numeric vector (scalar) containing neighborhood radius eps that was used.}

\item{\code{sort}}{A logical value indicating whether the distances are sorted.}

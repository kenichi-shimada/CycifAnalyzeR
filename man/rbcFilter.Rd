\title{remove cells that are positive for autofluorescence (AF). AF488 is used by default and set x@within_rois = FALSE when the values are higher than the gate.}
\usage{
rbcFilter(x, ...)

\S4method{rbcFilter}{Cycif}(x, ch = "AF488", gate)

\S4method{rbcFilter}{CycifStack}(x, ch = "AF488", gates)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A Cycif object.}

\item{ch}{A character value specifying the name of the channel.}

\item{gate}{A numerical value specifying the gate for the AF channel.}
}
\value{
A Cycif object with the defined ROIs.
}
\description{
This function modifies within_rois in Cycif object. this should run after importROIs().
}
\details{
This function provides an interactive way to define ROIs within a Cycif object. ROIs can be classified as either "positive" or "negative" based on their intended use. Users can set these ROIs by selecting points on the plot. For positive ROIs, cells within the polygonal boundaries are considered within the ROI. For negative ROIs, cells outside the polygonal boundaries are considered within the ROI. Users can set multiple ROIs of each type by following the prompts.
